This theme, like WordPress, is licensed under the GPL.
Use it to make something cool, have fun, and share what you've learned with others.

WhiteUnicorn is based on Underscores https://underscores.me/, (C) 2012-2017 Automattic, Inc.
Underscores is distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL v2 or later.

Normalizing styles have been helped along thanks to the fine work of
Nicolas Gallagher and Jonathan Neal https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/

//NOTE:
Source post-css styles are located in resources/css/
The compiled bundle is saved to `dist/css/bundle-${fingerprint}.css`
(dist/manifest.json provides the exact path mapping).

DEVELOPMENT.md file contains instructions how to get the compilation
process up & running.

If you need to make a quick fix, feel free to add CSS
below this comment -- it's loaded after the compiled bundle.
